**AI Context Craft** solves a common problem for developers using LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, or Llama: how do you feed an entire codebase to an AI that has a limited context window? This tool lets you intelligently select, filter, and concatenate your project files into a single, clean, context-optimized text file, ready to be pasted into any AI chat.

Stop manually copying and pasting files and start crafting the perfect context in seconds.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Powerful YAML Configuration**: Define exactly what to include and exclude using a simple `config.yaml` file.
*   **Intelligent Two-Step Filtering**: A robust `include-then-exclude` logic gives you granular control over your context. First, specify what you want with `include_patterns`, then clean it up with various exclusion filters.
*   **Advanced Python Code Processing**:
    *   `--strip-comments`: Reliably remove all comments and docstrings using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, not just simple regex.
    *   `--headers-only`: Create a high-level summary of your code by extracting only class and function signatures and their docstrings.
*   **Customizable Project Tree Generation**: Automatically generate a filtered file tree to give the LLM a clear overview of the project structure.
*   **Built-in Utilities**:
    *   Native `.gitignore` support to automatically exclude files you already ignore.
    *   Automatic token and size calculation with `tiktoken`.
    *   Verbose logging for easy debugging.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Currently, you can run the script directly by cloning the repository.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-context-craft.git
cd ai-context-craft

# (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install pyyaml tiktoken
```

### 2. Usage

Run the script from your terminal. By default, it looks for a `config.yaml` in the same directory and scans the current project.

```bash
# Generate context for the current directory
python aicc.py

# Specify project and output paths
python aicc.py -p /path/to/your/project -o /path/to/output/context.txt
```

#### Command-Line Options

| Flag                 | Description                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c`, `--config`     | Path to your YAML configuration file.                                     |
| `-p`, `--project`    | Path to the target project directory (default: current dir).              |
| `-o`, `--output`     | Path for the generated output file.                                       |
| `--strip-comments`   | Remove comments and docstrings from code files.                           |
| `--headers-only`     | Extract only function/class signatures and docstrings from Python files.  |
| `--use-gitignore`    | Automatically use the project's `.gitignore` file for exclusions.         |
| `--no-timestamp`     | Do not append a timestamp to the output filename.                         |
| `--dry-run`          | Run the script without writing any files to see what would be included.   |
| `-v`, `--verbose`    | Print detailed processing information to the console.                     |

### Example Workflow

Generate a context for a Python project, removing all comments and respecting the `.gitignore` file:

```bash
python aicc.py --project ./my-python-app --strip-comments --use-gitignore -v
```

This will create a file in the `build/` directory containing the project tree and the cleaned content of all relevant files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`config.yaml`)

The real power of **AI Context Craft** lies in its configuration. A `config.yaml` is automatically created on first run.

```yaml
# Default output file path.
output_path: "./build/project_context.txt"

# --- FILE SELECTION ---

# STEP 1: INCLUSION (Priority)
# Only files matching these glob patterns will be considered.
include_patterns:
  - '**/*' # Default: all files in all subdirectories

# STEP 2: EXCLUSION
# From the files included above, remove any that match these patterns.

# Filters applied to BOTH the file tree and content.
common_filters:
  - "__pycache__/"
  - "*.pyc"
  - ".git/"
  - ".venv/"
  - "node_modules/"
  - "build/"

# Excludes from file content ONLY (will still appear in the tree).
project_only_filters:
  - ""

# Excludes from the tree ONLY (content will still be included).
tree_only_filters:
  - "*.md"
  - "LICENSE"

# --- ADVANCED OPTIONS ---

# For --headers-only, functions/classes matching these names
# will have their full body included.
full_body_filters:
  - "main"
  - "run_app"
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project has a bright future! Our goal is to make it the most powerful and developer-friendly context-crafting tool available.

*   ‚úÖ **Phase 0: Foundation** - Refactor the codebase into a modular and testable architecture.
*   üöß **Phase 1: Pro Experience** - Add UX improvements like a progress bar (`tqdm`) and a `--clipboard` option.
*   üöÄ **Phase 2: The Universal Tool** - Extend comment stripping to multiple languages (JS, Java, C++, etc.), introduce configuration profiles, and add automatic output splitting for very large projects.
*   üß† **Phase 3: The Leap to Intelligence** - **Git diff integration** (`--git-diff <branch>`) to generate context only for changed files. Perfect for code reviews and PR descriptions.
